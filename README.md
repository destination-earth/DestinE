# DestinE

Destination Earth open source contributions

## Description

Destination Earth (DestinE) is an ambitious initiative of the European Union to create a highly accurate digital model of Earth that will be used to monitor the effects of natural and human activity on our planet, anticipate extreme events and adapt policies to climate-related challenges.

DestinE will unlock the potential of digital modelling of the Earth systems at a level that represents a real breakthrough in terms of accuracy, local detail, access-to-information speed and interactivity.

As part of the European Commission’s Green Deal and Digital Strategy, DestinE will contribute to achieving the objectives of the twin green and digital transition.

## Getting Started

In the DestinE GitHub open source organisation it is possible to find the following items:
* open source software related to DestinE initiative like the Use Cases developed under contracts with ECMWF, ESA and EUMETSAT 
* documentation generated under such contracts which follow the openess principle and are available for community review and contributions (e.g. user requirements, community engagement strategy, etc.)
* tools for contributing content to DestinE website
* links to open source repositories highly relevant to DestinE but developed outside the initiative

Items are stored in different repositories, which can be internal or external, with the name indicating the funding lines and Entrusted Entities (EE), in fact each repository name, apart the main one, includes a label code before the actual name, reporting:​

- funding line (DestineE=Destination Earth, HorizonE=Horizon Europe, Partnership=other partnerships,…)​
- in case of DestineE, the Entrusted Entities name​.
For instance:

- DestinE_ECMWF <Use Case #>
- DestinE_ESA <Use Case #>
- DestinE_EUMETSAT <Use Case #>

While if the repository is physically outside the Organisation the "XRL" (eXternal Repository Link) code is used after the funding line. For instance :

- Partnership_XRL <Project #>
- HorizonE_XRL <Project #>

Those repositories are just placeholders to allow to have in this organisation a comprehensive list of projects related to DestinE. They contains a short description of the project and a link to the actual repository.

This naming convention apply to each new repository created.

### Special repositories
In addition to Use Case and Partnership projects repositories the following repositories are also included in the organisation:

- **DestinE**: this reposotory, acting as landing page for the DestinE open-source community
- **DestinE_ESA_DESP_Use_Cases_Management**: reporting projects output open to community contribution( e.g. DESP user requirements, Community Building and Management Strategy, DestinE Exploitation Roadmap)
- **DestinE_ESA_Website**: allowing the community to propose content for the DestinE website
